# Stone Paper Scissor Game

Stone, Paper, Scissor is a popular hand game usually played by two people, in which both the players form one of the three shapes "Stone" (a closed fist), "Paper" (palm with all fingers outstretched) or "Scissor" (fist with index and middle finger extended to form V shape) simultaneously.
There are two possible outcomes of such a game: tie or a win for one player and lose of another.

In this project, image_data_generate.py is used to generate image data which is stored in image_dataset folder. There are four classes: "Stone", "Paper","Scissor" and "None". A Convolutional Neural Network Model is trained to obtained optimized weights. Later, this trained model is used to create an OpenCV based Game where one player is the user while other player is Computer.
